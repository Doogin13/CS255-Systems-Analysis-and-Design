# Briefly summarize the DrivePass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass noticed there were very few tools to help students pass their driving tests. Their research has found that more than 65% of the students applying for their driving license exams fail because all they had to prepare was previous tests. They wanted to provide students with practice exams online and on the road driver training. DriverPass wanted to develop a website that would allow users or customers to schedule and take practice tests online and schedule on the road driver training classes. They wanted the site to be available on all platforms where the users could make payments and be assigned drivers for on the road training. 

# What did you do particularly well?

The use case diagram showed how the actors interacted with the system and was a valuable tool for the development of the activity diagrams and the sequence diagram. I think I did particularly well in developing the activity diagram showing the functions and structure of certain areas in the system design.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick?  How would you improve it?

If I had to choose one part of my work on these documents to revise, I would choose the use case diagram because there are a lot of interactions between the actors and the system that I did not include and the more information that is included in each diagram gives the developers and testers a more accurate view of the client’s vision.

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

By conducting thorough interviews of the clients, I was able to develop the functional and non-functional requirements necessary for the development of a system design that would satisfy the needs of the clients and provide the best experience for the users. It is very important to consider the user’s needs when designing because users are new to the website and should be able to maneuver the website and make selections with ease and feel comfortable while online.

# How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I have learned in this course that you have to start with a simple design and then improve and add to the design. Start with the use case diagrams to determine the actors and their interactions with the system. Improve with the activity diagrams showing the functionality of the structure and then following up with the sequence diagram which gives a more detailed approach to the system design. I would use this approach in the future by carefully preparing and planning the initial design and by implementation stage, the design would be more developed.
